A telemeter for KSP.
--------------------
The code's in the public domain, although the model - compiled -
is the property of CardBoardBoxProcessor and it's unclear how he
wishes it to be distributed.

Since corax's telemetry module has disappeared, here's a replac-
-ement. On Windows, drag and drop it into your KSP folder and
configure it with the config.xml file. UDP only, works with KSP 
versions > 1.7.

Built on VS2010. Haven't gotten this working on a full Mono too-
-lchain just yet.
